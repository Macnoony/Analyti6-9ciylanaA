A patent is a right, limited in time, assigned to an inventor or his legal representative for the beneficial economic use of an invention. Purchased patents are to be capitalized, whereas the costs for internally generated patents including registration fees and R&D expenditures are expenses directly through profit and loss.
Copyrights
Copyrights arise from the creation of an asset by personal input of the creator. A one-off payment for the acquisition of a copyright is capitalized; however, regular license payments as well as costs resulting from the internal generation of copyrights are expenses directly through profit and loss.
