# Automated Accounting Advisor
scope:  involves the development of an interactive Web application with a chat-interface where users submit inquiries on how to post specific business transactions into General Ledger Accounting. First, the system leverages its intelligent search capability to find the most relevant match from the stored sections of the organizationâ€™s Accounting Manual - these reference documents are prepared and stored as vector embeddings within the HANA Vector engine beforehand. Once the best match is found, text information from the corresponding section of the Accounting Manual is annexed to the user's inquiry along with additional (technical) instructions. This compiled information is then dispatched to the SAP AI Hub LLM model.
The output from the LLM model  to  an API call to the SAP S/4HANA General Ledger API. Upon completion of this process, the user is provided with a response. If a query cannot be resolved, the system equally provides feedback to the user, keeping them engaged and informed.
